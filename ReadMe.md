## About The Project
- As we all know that after covid and online colleges, students cannot find where to learn the skills that can make them have better understanding about the course they have taken.
- Everyone was not ready for online classes and we all know how much we have learned in our online classes.
- So to remove the gap between online classes and students, we bring a platfrom where students can find their passion and work on their upskilling for better understanding.
- We will provide a platform where teachers can upload their courses and post the required resources for the students.
- Students can find their appropriate course and start learning.
